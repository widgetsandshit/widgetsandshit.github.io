  <div class="post-content">Java is an awesome language because you get to ignore hard stuff like memory allocation.&nbsp; Write once, run anywhere.&nbsp; Sweet, where do I sign up?<br /><br />The privilege of not having to manage memory comes at a cost: you aren't allowed to question how the JVM works.&nbsp; Move along, coder.&nbsp; Keep making those objects.&nbsp; Don't ask how much memory things take up. In fact, to keep you from getting curious, we're not even going to have a <code>sizeof</code> function.<br /><font style="font-size: 1.25em;"><b><br />How My Complacency Made Me Fail</b></font><br /><br />When you're coding in Java, it's easy to buy into this mentality.&nbsp; You never really have to worry about how much space anything takes up, and if you get an <code>OutOfMemoryError</code>, just give the JVM more memory.&nbsp; Problem solved.<br /><br />But there are times when you need to be conscious of how the JVM actually works.&nbsp; For example, when you're trying to squeeze every bit of performance out of the crappiest of machines, such the small Amazon EC2 instances (where Persai is hosted).<br /><br />Here's a real world example of how I got burned:<br /><br />Persai does a lot of work with high-dimensionality, sparse vectors.&nbsp; To save space, we compact the vectors.&nbsp; Since most of the values in the vectors are zero, we simply do not store them.&nbsp; What we store amounts to a list of the nonzero element indices and the corresponding values.&nbsp; This is our basic data structure:<br /><br /> 
<pre>class sparseNode {
    public int index;
    public double value;
}
</pre>
So a vector is an array of <code>sparseNode</code> objects. Sounds easy enough, and for a while, it was.&nbsp; That is until I was tasked with storing as many of these  in memory as I could.<br /><br />Where's the fail here?&nbsp; How big is an <code>int</code> primitive in Java? 32 bits, right?&nbsp; Sort of.&nbsp; The Java specification says that an implementation must provide 32 bits of workable space for the programmer using an <code>int</code>, but makes no mention of how how the virtual machine must store this variable.<br /><br />In Sun's HotSpot JVM, object storage is aligned to the nearest 64-bit boundary.&nbsp; On top of this, every object has a 2-word header in memory.&nbsp; The JVM's word size is usually the platform's native pointer size.&nbsp; Alright, two words for the object header, one word for the <code>int</code>, two words for the double.&nbsp; That's 5 words: 160 bits.&nbsp; Because of the alignment, this object will occupy 192 bits of memory.&nbsp; Effectively, the <code>int</code> value is taking 64 bits!&nbsp; In an array of these things, I've wasted N times 32 bits.&nbsp; Figure, a typical vector is about 200 elements long, so that's 800 bytes out the window for each one.<br /><br />This fun fact would have been good to know when I was doing my initial back of the envelope calculation of how many vectors I can fit in a gigabyte of memory.<br /><br />Yes, I know I should be complaining about the same thing when using C structs.&nbsp; But you know what?&nbsp; When you learn C, you are introduced to many harsh realities.&nbsp; When you learn Java, you are introduced to XML.&nbsp; They protect you from the hard things.&nbsp; Live and learn, I guess.<br /><br /><font style="font-size: 1.25em;"><b>The Fix</b></font><br /><br />After knowing this, it was easy to rescue myself.&nbsp; Java primitive arrays fall to the same alignment issue, but in our case, they can help solve the problem.&nbsp; Instead of representing a vector as an <i>array of objects</i>, we'll represent a vector as an <i>object of arrays</i>.<br /><br />

<pre>class sparseVector {
  public int[] indicies;
  public double[] values;
}
</pre>

This way, we're going to lose at most 4 bytes per vector with the alignment of the <code>int[]</code> array.&nbsp; This sure beats the ~800 byte loss with the other solution.<br />
