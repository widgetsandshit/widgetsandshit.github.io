  <div class="post-content"><img alt="hurrdurr.gif" src="/teddziuba/images/hurrdurr.gif" class="post-lead-image" style="margin: 0pt 0pt 20px 20px; float: right;" height="286" width="317" />I'm working with a startup now on a text summarization project.&nbsp; The requirements are fairly loose: "take all this text and make it smaller", solving the tl;dr problem (too long; didn't read).&nbsp; There are a couple of critical details, namely identifying the sentiment of the text, and a few others that are excruciatingly domain-specific.<br /><br />At first glance, this seems approachable with some natural language processing libraries.&nbsp; Oh no.&nbsp; There be dragons.&nbsp; At Pressflip, I had myself into a few NLP libraries, and the only takeaway I got from all that experience was <i>"Don't use NLP.&nbsp; Ever."</i><br /><br />Why?&nbsp; NLP is yucky.&nbsp; It's complicated, the field is rife with academic shitheaddery, there are some major-asspain licensing issues with a couple of software packages and best of all, it's balls slow.&nbsp; Plus, if you venture down the road of natural language processing, the law of diminishing returns will pull you into a dark alley, pummel you with a tire iron, take you wallet, and then just to be a prick, steal your shoes so you need to walk home barefoot.<br /><br />My point is, for 99 practical projects out of 100, you can cheat your way out of NLP.&nbsp; Cook up some fancy shit with word frequencies and logarithms.&nbsp; Reach back into your information retrieval notes for inspiration.&nbsp; TF*IDF can take you a long way if you know how to use it.<br /><br />When I was brainstorming the project I'm working on, my first thought was some hand-waving business about a part-of-speech tagger and a Markov Chain to figure out probabilities of part-of-speech transitions and all that fancy shit.&nbsp; Factor in a little bit of sentiment detection from God-knows-where and that was my sketch.&nbsp; Then practicality set in: how much time do you want to spend on this?&nbsp;<b> If you are considering NLP as the answer to a real problem, it's virtually certain that you're overthinking it</b>. <br /><br />That being said, NLP does have its place: <a href="http://www.powerset.com/">making the best fucking Wikipedia search engine there ever was with technology licensed from Xerox and then selling yourself to Microsoft</a>.<br />
