  <div class="post-content"><img alt="i-disagree.jpg" src="/teddziuba/images/i-disagree.jpg" class="post-lead-image" style="margin: 0pt 0pt 20px 20px; float: right;" height="230" width="307" /> <div>When I was a kid, I used to help my Dad work on the family cars.&nbsp; We changed the oil, brake pads, repaired a broken hydraulic line, and fixed faulty air conditioning.<br /><br />It wasn't too long before I was able to do most basic repair and maintenance myself.&nbsp; In college, I spent hours fixing an electrical problem that caused my rear turn signals to go out.<br /><br />Recently, my car started to make a weird "coughing" noise from the muffler, and I fixed that, too.<br /><br /><b>This Is Going Somewhere I Swear</b><br /><br />Why is this relevant to programming?&nbsp; Well, one of my favorite parts about programming production services is forensic debugging.&nbsp; Some process crashes in the middle of the night and all you're left with is a beeper going apeshit and a stack trace.&nbsp; What went wrong?&nbsp; How do you debug that?<br /><br />Debugging a car is the same thing, but a lot harder.&nbsp; With a car, the symptoms of the bug aren't usually very concrete: a funny noise, a bad smell, a jittery feeling.&nbsp; Compared to a computer, a car is a very simple machine, but because it's so simple it's much harder to debug.&nbsp; Newer cars have an electronic interface to tell you what sensors are indicating faults, but that doesn't always solve the problem.&nbsp; Plus, the sensor readers are like $300.<br /><br />The more you work on a car, the more you develop an intuition about it.&nbsp; In code, you can narrow your bug down and fix it.&nbsp; With a car, you narrow the fault down to a couple of suspect parts and start by replacing the cheapest one.&nbsp; For me, fixing a car problem is much more gratifying than fixing a code problem because of the tangibility of it.<br /><br />So, if you're enjoy debugging and problem solving, you'd probably like auto mechanics.&nbsp; There are a couple of collateral upshots to it: you save some money, you can give your friends car advice, and you get to buy a bunch of really awesome tools.&nbsp; <br /><br />No one can pull your man card when you have a specialized wrench for an O2 sensor.<br /></div>
