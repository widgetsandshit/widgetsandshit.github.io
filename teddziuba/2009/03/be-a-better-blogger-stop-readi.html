  <div class="post-content"><img alt="three-days-hike-to-the-douchebag-dharma-station.jpg" src="/teddziuba/images/douchebag-dharma-station.jpg" class="post-lead-image" style="margin: 0pt 0pt 20px 20px; float: right;" height="478" width="206" /> <div>The greatest hope of internet generation is that you can share your thoughts with everybody in the world.&nbsp; The greatest letdown of the same generation is that nobody cares.&nbsp; Still, that doesn't keep us from trying.<br /><br />Bloggers are good people, generally.&nbsp; We're self confident in a passive aggressive sort of way, we're opinionated, and best of all, we can type quickly.&nbsp; But what separates bloggers from each other?&nbsp; Those who can break exclusive news usually have a good following, but what about the rest of us?&nbsp; How do you actually get better at blogging?<br /><br />Not that you asked for it, but this is my advice: read more, write less.&nbsp; By "read more", I mean books.&nbsp; Newspapers are useless, because the job of every newspaper editor is to remove any semblance of personality from all of the text.&nbsp; It's just facts, and facts are fuckin' <i>boring</i>.&nbsp; If you want to cruise programming.reddit a few times a day and write reactionary articles, fine, live with that crowd.&nbsp; It's not an interesting place to be, though.&nbsp; Telling the world why you think DHH is wrong about some programming methodology isn't going to get you a column at Rolling Stone.<br /><br />Getting on the front page of Digg is not an accomplishment.<br /><br />Blogarrhea begets blogarrhea.&nbsp; There's a continuous global discussion on the internet, and if you're not the one who started it, you're just background noise.&nbsp; People like Paul Graham and Dave Winer never really say anything original, they just enjoy the act of typing.&nbsp; Graham has been re-writing the same three essays for almost a decade, and Winer, well, Winer doesn't have much to do during the day, and at least blogging keeps him away from drugs and rap music. I guess it's a positive influence.<br /><br />If you want to keep that company, do so, but like programming, writing is so much better when you value elegance as well as functionality.<br /><br />Which brings me to my second point.&nbsp; Write less.<br /><br />For the last two months, I have been working my way through a pile of books: everything ever published by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_palahniuk">Chuck Palahniuk</a> (tl;dr: the guy who wrote Fight Club).&nbsp; I'm almost done, a book and a half to go.&nbsp; Chuck likes to do these writers' workshops, and somebody once asked him what he does when he's stuck.&nbsp; He knows where the story needs to go, but just doesn't know how to get it there.<br /><br />Chuck's response: "Did you ever go into the bathroom and try and take a shit when you didn't have to go?"<br /><br />Whenever I sit down to write a post here, it's because I really have to take a dump.&nbsp; Incidentally, sometimes when I write for The Register, it feels like I'm really trying to squeeze one out.&nbsp; If I end up dead from an aneurysm, that's what happened.  Setting a post-per-week quota for yourself is like setting a lines-of-code quota at work.<br /><br />Don't write just because you want to spend some time on the pot.&nbsp; Do it because you really have to go.<br /></div>
