  <div class="post-content"><img alt="obama-winning-the-nobel-proves-that-white-guilt-is-one-of-the-most-awesome-powers-on-earth.jpg" src="/teddziuba/images/obama-winning-the-nobel-proves-that-white-guilt-is-one-of-the-most-awesome-powers-on-earth.jpg" width="210" height="840" class="post-lead-image" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 20px 20px;" /> <div>Why would you ever hire a programmer who doesn't program in his free time? &nbsp;I mean, a person who doesn't compile recreationally is probably useless on the job. &nbsp;You might as well hire somebody ... <i>old</i>. And who wants a bunch of people around the office who whine about things like <i>healthcare benefits</i>? Just don't get sick, duh.</div><div><br /></div><div>I love it when twenty-something engineers take such a hard-line position on something they have so little experience with, like hiring. &nbsp;Saying that you wouldn't hire somebody for a programming job because they don't program in their spare time is blissfully naive. Yeah, I remember the days when my greatest responsibility to another human being was making rent on the first of the month.</div><div><br /></div><div>If I am going to hire somebody for a programming job, I don't really give a shit <i>what</i> they do in their spare time, so long as that person is very good at the task at hand. &nbsp;I don't ask questions about what a person does in their free time in job interviews because I don't care, and because that can sometimes open the door to an illegal conversation. (What's that? There are laws about what you can ask somebody in a job interview? Who thought that up, Republicans?)</div><div><br /></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); ">Me, I can count on one hand the number of times I've programmed outside of work or a class. &nbsp;There was only once when I actually enjoyed it, though. I was in college, and shared a common wall with a girl from Spain who was painfully unaware that her computer had a volume control knob. She would stay up late on AOL instant messenger, and I couldn't sleep. &nbsp;So, I rigged up a Python script to play AOL instant messenger sounds randomly every 5 to 10 seconds, turned up my speakers, pointed them at the wall, and went on vacation for a week. &nbsp;And thus, the asshole you all know and love is born.</span></div><div><br /></div><div>I don't enjoy programming so much as I enjoy the satisfaction I get from cracking hard problems.<span class="Apple-style-span" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); ">&nbsp;In that case, computer code is a means to an end, but so is my Craftsman socket set. &nbsp;I like to spend free time wrenching on a car or a bike, but I don't set out on Saturday morning and say "I'm going to learn how to use a torque wrench today, because those things are the future of tools". &nbsp;</span></div><div><br /></div><div>I would not want to work for a company that wouldn't hire me because I don't code in my spare time. Professional development? Working at a startup, I get a heaping helping of that on the job. &nbsp;Keeping up with new technology? Yeah, I read reddit, and again, startup. &nbsp;You know what's more awesome than spending my Saturday afternoon learning Haskell by hacking away at a few Project Euler problems? Fuck, ANYTHING.</div><div><br /></div><div>Really, why should I bother spending time with my family and taking an active role in my kids' development when there's a dead-beaten math puzzle that doesn't have a good answer in Clojure? &nbsp;"I won't hire someone who doesn't code in their free time" is Siliconvallese for "I don't want to hire any grownups because they remind me of my parents".</div>
