class="post-lead-image">What's with all the hate on my generation? It started when somebody
 quit Jason Calacanis's industrial web spam startup, Mahalo, for a higher
paying position at a competitor. Invariably, Calacanis went apeshit on
the poor guy in a very public way, and this started a cascade of blogosphere
butthurt about people in software under thirty: that we're unreliable,
that we're lazy, that we're entitled.</p>

<p>Well I'm as unreliable, lazy, and entitled as the next guy, but that's not
why I've hopped jobs in the past. People in my generation have a very
low tolerance for bullshit, and software engineering, in general, is a
very high bullshit career. If you couple that with the standard load
of bullshit you would get from a non-technical Harvard MBA type boss &mdash;
like many CEOs that you find trying to get rich in Silicon Valley by
hiring some engineers to "code up this idea real quick" &mdash; it's no
wonder that a good engineer will walk off the job after his one year
cliff vesting.</p>

<p>As an engineer, you are told that you're "lucky to have a job", because there are "a hundred people lined up
outside, ready to take it". (As chance would have it, there are at
least a thousand lined up to take the job of <em>rich prick who tells
people what to do</em>). This backlash is the product of diseased
thinking. A CEO who makes an engineer work 80 hours a week is a driven
entrepreneur, but an engineer asking for a comfy chair is a prima
donna. So, when we are up to our knees in golf-course, martini-lunch
bullshit, don't be surprised when we jump ship for a higher
salary.</p>

<p>I recognize the value of business people and
management. Somebody has to sell the code that I write, which in turn
puts food on my table. Since I <em>am</em> an engineer, I like
iterative optimization. Every time I have left a job, I have
further refined the requirements that a person must fill before I agree to work for him. After every job, I add one or two requirements to the list, and
I have found that my happiness at work improves dramatically with
every step.</p>

<p>This is my current list:

<ul>
  <li>The organization must need me at least as much as I need it.</li>
  <li>My direct manager must have a technical background &mdash; enough to understand why programming is hard.</li>
  <li>My direct manager must have enough experience or raw intelligence such that I can trust him/her to make decisions, even though I may not understand the reasoning.</li>
  <li>I must have absolute faith in the business plan.</li>
  <li>I must have absolute faith in "the business side" to execute that plan.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>So, Jason, when that fellow quit Mahalo, he didn't just leave you
in the lurch. He added something to his list. Maybe you should find
out what that is.</p>
