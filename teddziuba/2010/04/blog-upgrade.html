<p>So that's it, I'm finally done with Movable Type. I had upgraded my
  4.x install to the newest 5.x, and the process was nothing but a
  colossal fuckup. After the fact, my site was compromised 4 times by
  my last count &mdash; some bot set up a handful of phishing pages
  here. RSA security caught it, notified Dreamhost, and they shut me down a
  couple of times.</p>

<p>Anyhow, rather than figure out the attack vector with Movable Type,
  I decided to scrap it and
  use <a href="http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll" rel="nofollow">Jekyll</a>. It only took me a day and a
  couple of angry Python scripts to migrate all my shit to Jekyll from
  MT. Comments are still off because I don't care in the slightest
  what people have to say, and certainly not enough to slow my stuff
  down with Javascript.</p>

<p>One of the reasons I used MT in the first place was that it
  generated static HTML pages for all posts, instead of doing
  something silly like querying a database to generate what amounts to
  static content. Because of this, my pages load (first request to
  final render) in about 300
  milliseconds on my home connection. For comparison, techcrunch.com
  can take upwards of 1 minute from first request to final render.</p>

<p>In this regard, Jekyll feels right. I can keep everything under
  version control, the templating is only marginally braindead, and
  the publishing step is rsync. After using Jekyll, I feel like every
  other blogging engine out there is telling me, <em>"You'll shoot
  your eye out, kid!"</em>.</p>

<p>It's also come to my attention that the re-do with Jekyll has
  caused my posts to show up afresh in all of your Google Reader
  accounts. This was unintentional, but a nice benefit. It's true,
  this is the greatest web site on the internet, and everything you
  need to know, you can find out here.</p>
