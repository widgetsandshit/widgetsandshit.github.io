Crawling my site is fine, and republishing is cool too. What bugs me is when you
scrape my shit, republish it with or without attribution, and then run AdSense
against it. I regularly help myself to other peoples' images, but I don't make
any money off of them, so when they butthurt to me over it, I will either give
attribution or tell them to sit on it and spin.
